<p>This is my roster picture form my sophmore year. Last year went to the first round of the NCAA and got to go to Hawaii to play.
  
  <p>My sophmore year we won the Big Sky tournament that was in califorina. It was so much fun and I will remember it for the rest of my life and tell my kids about it.</p>
