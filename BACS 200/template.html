    <p>When I graduate college, I want to be compliance director of a college. I don't want to go back to Minnesota, I hope to stay here in Colorado. I love watching college sports, but I would also want to be compliance of a professional sports team.</p>
    <p>In my free time I love to go hiking in my free time. I love being in the outdoors and getting the chance to get out of Greeley and see the beautiful mountains. I am also thinking about getting a cat I think that they are easy to take care of and also fun.</p>
